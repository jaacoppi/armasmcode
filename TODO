== testing == 
1. make disarm accept a command line argument to open a specific file.
2. create one opcode source files to be disarmed:
ldr x5, =address
mov x10, 0x10FA
bl =address
etc
md5sum the results and test against them so the functionality will not change

== Memory handling ==
dynamic memory handling, starting with removing static tmpstr 

== System emulation ==
Make it work.
A proper toolchain, maybe binutils-arm-none-eabi or one with aarch64


== c library ==
feof() and ferror from stdio.h for detecting EOF and errors from file operations
