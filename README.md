## About ##
These files contain 64-bit ARM (aka A64, ARM64, aarch64) assembly code for the GNU as and ld.

The code contains snippets of:
	* standard C library (stdlib.a)
	* Bare bones OS (armv8bin) using qemu-system-aarch64
	* userland programs using linux syscalls

If there'll ever be a proper hardware target, this codebase might become an operating system.
